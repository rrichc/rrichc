## Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Richard Chen

Full stack software engineer with web, react native, and native iOS development experience. I'm passionate about exploring the different ways LLMs, specifically AI agents can be used to amplify human productivity and really deliver on solving niche problems.

Currently, I'm building [ReHash (www.rehash.gg)](https://www.rehash.gg), an AI-powered software engineer interview mobile app companion. Think Strava x Duolingo x Leetcode. The goal is to make technical practice like LeetCode more accessible and interactive. I'm engineering an adaptive AI tutor using a LangGraph Supervisor-Agent pattern within a full-stack React Native application (iOS, Android, Web) to provide contextual guidance and adaptive learning.

I continue to be amazed by the speed of advancement of AI everyday am always open to connecting with others interested in innovative AI applications and impactful engineering.
